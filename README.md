## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains a collection of small projects that I have worked on while learning Python. Each project serves as a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a proficient software developer.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

All projects are stored within this single repository and cosists of a Python script (.py file) implementing the functionality.

ðŸ“Œ Future Plans

I plan to add more beginner friendly projects, as well as improve to include more advanced projects. I also want to improve code readability and optimization while learning backend development. 

This repository is mainly for my learning journey as I move through completing my Computer Science degree, but feel free to create your own version, suggest improvements, or open issues if you have any feedback!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
