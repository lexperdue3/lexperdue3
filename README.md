## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Python Projects repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains a collection of small projects that I have worked on while learning Python. Each project serves as a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a proficient software developer.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each project is stored in its own directory and includes:

1. A Python script (.py file) implementing the project

2. A README file with a brief description of the project and how to run it

3. Sample input/output files or images, if applicable

ðŸ“Œ Future Plans

I plan to add more beginner friendly projects, as well as improve to include more advanced projects. I also want to improve code readability and optimization while learning backend development. 

This repository is mainly for my learning journey as I move through completing my Computer Science degree, but feel free to fork it, suggest improvements, or open issues if you have any feedback!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
